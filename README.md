# Language Detection Model Using NLP

Hey Guys, welcome to the **Language Detection Model**! This is a powerful language prediction tool built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model can detect 17 different languages with high accuracy. Whether you're working on a multilingual project or need a quick way to identify the language of a given text, this model has got you covered!

## Supported Languages

The model can predict the following 17 languages:

1. **English**
2. **Malayalam**
3. **Hindi**
4. **Tamil**
5. **Kannada**
6. **French**
7. **Spanish**
8. **Portuguese**
9. **Italian**
10. **Russian**
11. **Swedish**
12. **Dutch**
13. **Arabic**
14. **Turkish**
15. **German**
16. **Danish**
17. **Greek**

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Detects 17 different languages.
- **High Accuracy**: Built using advanced NLP techniques for precise language detection.
- **Fast Prediction**: Quickly identifies the language of any input text.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for integration with other projects.

## Installation

To get started with the Language Detection Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-detection-model.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd language-detection-model


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
After installation, you can use the model to detect the language of any text. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

from language_detection import detect_language

text = "Bonjour tout le monde"  # Example text
language = detect_language(text)
print(f"The detected language is: {language}")


How It Works
The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze the given text and identify its language based on predefined patterns, syntax, and semantics. It is trained on a large dataset to ensure high accuracy in language detection.
